What Does the Lord Require

Verse 1
What does the Lord require for praise and offering?
What sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?

Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

Verse 2
Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?
Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?

Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

Verse 3
How shall our life fulfil God’s law so hard and high?
Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.

Then justly, in mercy we’ll humbly walk with God.
