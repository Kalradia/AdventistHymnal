Day Is Dying in the West

Verse 1
Day is dying in the west;
Heaven is touching earth with rest;

Wait and worship while the night
Sets the evening lamps alight

Through all the sky.

Chorus
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!

Verse 2
Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home,

Gather us who seek Thy face
To the fold of Thy embrace,

For Thou art nigh.

Chorus
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!

Verse 3
While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love enfolding all,

Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,

Our hearts ascend.

Chorus
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!

Verse 4
When forever from our sight
Pass the stars, the day, the night,

Lord of angels, on our eyes
Let eternal morning rise

And shadows end.

Chorus
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!

Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!
