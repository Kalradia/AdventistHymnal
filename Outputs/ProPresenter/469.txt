Leaning on the Everlasting Arms

Verse 1
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
leaning on the everlasting arms;

what a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
leaning on the everlasting arms.

Chorus
Leaning, leaning,
safe and secure from all alarms;

leaning, leaning,
leaning on the everlasting arms.

Verse 2
O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
leaning on the everlasting arms;

O how bright the path grows from day to day,
leaning on the everlasting arms.

Verse 3
What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
leaning on the everlasting arms?

I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
leaning on the everlasting arms.
