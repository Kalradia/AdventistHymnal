I Need the Prayers

Verse 1
I need the prayers of those I love,
While trav’ling o’er life’s rugged way,

That I may true and faithful be,
And live for Jesus every day.

Chorus
I want my friends to pray for me,
To bear my tempted soul above,

And intercede with God for me;
I need the prayers of those I love.

Verse 2
I need the prayers of those I love,
To help me in each trying hour,

To bear my tempted soul to Him,
That He may keep me by His pow’r.

Chorus
I want my friends to pray for me,
To bear my tempted soul above,

And intercede with God for me;
I need the prayers of those I love.

Verse 3
I want my friends to pray for me,
To hold me up on wings of faith,

That I may walk the narrow way,
Kept by our Father’s glorious grace.

Chorus
I want my friends to pray for me,
To bear my tempted soul above,

And intercede with God for me;
I need the prayers of those I love.
