God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;

Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;

when dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;

lean, weary one, upon his breast,
God will take care of you.

he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.
