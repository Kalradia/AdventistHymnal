My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less

Verse 1
My hope is built on nothing less
than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.

I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

Chorus
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,

all other ground is sinking sand.

Verse 2
When Darkness veils his lovely face,
I rest on his unchanging grace.

in every high and stormy gale,
my anchor holds within the veil.

Chorus
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,

all other ground is sinking sand.

Verse 3
His oath, his covenant, his blood
supports me in the whelming flood.

When all around my soul gives way,
he then is all my hope and stay.

Chorus
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,

all other ground is sinking sand.

Verse 4
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in him be found!

Dressed in his righteousness alone,
faultless to stand before the throne.

Chorus
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
all other ground is sinking sand,

all other ground is sinking sand.
