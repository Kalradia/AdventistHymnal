Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise

Verse 1
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great Name we praise.

Verse 2
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;

Thy justice, like mountains, high soaring above
Thy clouds, which are fountains of goodness and love.

Verse 3
To all, life Thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;

We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish - but naught changeth Thee.

Verse 4
Great Father of glory, pure Father of light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;

All praise we would render; O help us to see
â€™Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee!
