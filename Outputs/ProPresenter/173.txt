Good Christian Friends, Rejoice!

Verse 1
Good Christian friends, rejoice and sing!
Now is the triumph of our King!

To all the world glad news we bring
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 2
The Lord of life is risen for aye;
Bring flowers of song to strew His way;

Let all mankind rejoice and say
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 3
Praise we in songs of victory
That love, that life which cannot die,

And sing with hearts uplifted high
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Verse 4
Thy name we bless, O risen Lord,
And sing today with one accord

The life laid down, the life restored
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
