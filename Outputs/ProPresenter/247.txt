SDA Hymnal #247
Come, My Way

Verse 1
Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life
such a way as gives us breath,

such a truth as ends all strife,
such a life as killeth death.

Verse 2
Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength
such a light as shows a feast,

such a feast as mends in length,
such a strength as makes his guest.

Verse 3
Come, my Joy, my Love, my Heart
such a joy as none can move,

such a love as none can part,
such a heart as joys in love.
