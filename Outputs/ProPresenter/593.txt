In Times Like These

Verse 1
In times like these you need a Saviour,
In times like these you need and anchor;

Be very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!

This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
This Rock is Jesus, The only One!

Be very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!

Verse 2
In times like these you need the Bible,
In times like these O be not idle;

Be very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!

This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
This Rock is Jesus, The only One!

Be very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!

Verse 3
In times like these I have a Saviour,
In times like these I have an anchor

I’m very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!

This Rock is Jesus, Yes, He’s the One;
This Rock is Jesus, The only One!

I’m very sure, be very sure
Your anchor holds and grips the Solid rock!
