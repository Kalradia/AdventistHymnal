O Come, All Ye Faithful

Verse 1
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!

Come and behold Him, born the King of angels!
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,

O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

Verse 2
Sing, choirs of angels sing in exultation,
O sing all ye citizens of heaven above!

Glory to God, all glory in the highest!
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,

O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

Verse 3
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning,
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;

Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
O come, let us adore Him, O come, let us adore Him,

O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
