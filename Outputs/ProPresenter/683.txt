Jesus, Stand Among Us

Verse 1
Jesus, stand among us
In Thy risen power;

Let this time of worship
Be a hallowed hour.

Verse 2
Breathe the Holy Spirit
Into every heart;

Bid the fears and sorrows
From each soul depart.

Verse 3
Thus with quickened footsteps
We pursue our way,

Watching for the dawning
Of eternal day.
