Because He Lives

Verse 1
God sent His Son,
they called Him Jesus,

He came to love,
heal, and forgive;

He lived and died
to buy my pardon,

An empty grave is there to prove
my Saviour lives.

Chorus
Because He lives
I can face tomorrow,

Because He lives
all fear is gone;

Because I know
He holds the future.

And life is worth the living
just because He lives.

Verse 2
How sweet to hold
a newborn baby,

And feel the pride,
and joy He gives;

But greater still
the calm assurance,

This child can face uncertain days
because He lives.

Chorus
Because He lives
I can face tomorrow,

Because He lives
all fear is gone;

Because I know
He holds the future.

And life is worth the living
just because He lives.
