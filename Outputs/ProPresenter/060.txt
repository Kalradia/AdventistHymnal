Blessed Jesus at Thy Word

Verse 1
Blessed Jesus, at Thy word,
We have gathered all to hear Thee;

By Thy word our hearts were stirred,
Now to seek and love and fear Thee.

By Thy teachings sweet and holy,
Let us learn to love Thee solely.

Verse 2
All our knowledge, sense, and sight,
Lie in deepest darkness shrouded;

Till Thy Spirit breaks our night,
With His beams of truth unclouded.

He alone to God canst win us,
He who works all good within us.

Verse 3
Glorious Lord, Thy self impart!
Light of light, from God proceeding.

Open Thou our ears and heart
Help us, by Thy Spiritâ€™s pleading.

Hear the cry Thy people raises!
Hear, and bless our prayer and praises!
