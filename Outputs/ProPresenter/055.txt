Jesus, Tender Shepherd, Hear Me

Verse 1
Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
Bless Thy little lamb tonight;

Through the darkness be Thou near me;
Watch my sleep till morning light.

Verse 2
All this day Thy hand has led me,
And I thank Thee for Thy care;

Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me;
Listen to my evening prayer.
