SDA Hymnal #544
Jesus, Son of Blessed Mary

Verse 1
Jesus, Son of blessed Mary,
Once on earth a little child,

Pattern fair of holy living,
Gracious, loving, undefiled;

Verse 2
Though Thy eager heart was yearning
Heavy laden souls to free,

Yet Thou calledst little children
In their happiness to Thee.

Verse 3
Grant that we, like little children,
Free from pride and guile my be;

Cheerful, trusting, safe, protected
By the blessed Trinity.
