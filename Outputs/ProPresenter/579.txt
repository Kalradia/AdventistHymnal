’Tis Love That Makes Us Happy

Verse 1
’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Chorus
God is love; we’re His little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.

’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Verse 2
This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death, and sin;

With loving heart we’ll do our part,
And try some soul to win.

Chorus
God is love; we’re His little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.

’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

Verse 3
And when this life is over,
And we are called above

Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and His love.

Chorus
God is love; we’re His little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.

’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;

It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.
