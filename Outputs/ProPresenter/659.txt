May the Grace of Christ Our Saviour

Verse 1
May the grace of Christ our Saviour
And the Father’s boundless love,

With the Holy Spirit’s favour,
Rest upon them from above.

Verse 2
Thus may they abide in union
With each other and the Lord,

And possess, in sweet communion,
Joys which earth cannot afford.
