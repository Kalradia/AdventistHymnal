My Soul, Be on Thy Guard

Verse 1
My soul, be on they guard!
Ten thousand foes arise;

The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.

Verse 2
O watch, and fight, and pray!
The battle ne’er give o’er;

Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.

Verse 3
Ne’er think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;

Thy arduous task will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.
