Holy Spirit, Hear Us

Verse 1
Holy Spirit, hear us;
Help us while we sing;

Breath into the music
Of the praise we bring.

Verse 2
Holy Spirit, prompt us
When we kneel to pray;

Nearer come, and teach us
What we ought to say.

Verse 3
Holy Spirit, shine Thou
On the Book we read;

Gild itâ€™s holy pages
With the light we need.
