Now the Day Is Over

Verse 1
Now the day is over,
night is drawing nigh,

Shadows of the evening
steal across the sky.

Verse 2
Father, give the weary,
calm and sweet repose;

With Thy tenderest blessing
May our eyelids close.

Verse 3
Through the long night watches,
may thine angels spread

Their white wings above me,
watching round my bed.
