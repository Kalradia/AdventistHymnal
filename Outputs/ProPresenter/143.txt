Silent Night, Holy Night

Verse 1
Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright;

Round yon virgin mother and Child!
Holy Infant so tender and mild,

Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Verse 2
Silent night, holy night,
Darkness flies, all is light;

Shepherds hear the angels sing,
Alleluia! hail the King!

Christ the Saviour is born,
Christ the Saviour is born.

Verse 3
Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, love's pure light;

Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace,

Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth,
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.

Verse 4
Silent night, holy night,
Wondrous star, lend thy light;

With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;

Christ the Savior is born,
Christ the Savior is born.
