Moment by Moment

Verse 1
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,
Living with Jesus, a new life divine,

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Chorus
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Verse 2
Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,

Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment I’m under His care.

Chorus
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Verse 3
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;

Never a danger but there on teh throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

Chorus
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Verse 4
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;

Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me still.

Chorus
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;

Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.
