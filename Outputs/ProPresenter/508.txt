Anywhere With Jesus

Verse 1
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;

Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

Chorus
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

Verse 2
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;

Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

Chorus
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

Verse 3
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the gloomy shadows round about me creep,

Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home sweet home.

Chorus
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.
