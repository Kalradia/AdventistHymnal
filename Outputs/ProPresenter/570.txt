Not I, But Christ

Verse 1
Not I, but Christ,
be honoured, loved, exalted;

Not I, but Christ,
be seen, be known, be heard;

Not I, but Christ,
in every look and action,

Not I, but Christ,
in every thought and word.

Verse 2
Not I, but Christ,
to gently soothe in sorrow,

Not I, but Christ,
to wipe the falling tear;

Not I, but Christ,
to lift the weary burden,

Not I, but Christ,
to hush away all fear.

Verse 3
Christ, only Christ!
No idle words e’er falling,

Christ, only Christ;
no needless bustling sound;

Christ, only Christ,
no self important bearing;

Christ, only Christ,
no trace of “I” be found.

Verse 4
Not I, but Christ,
my every need supplying,

Not I, but Christ,
my strength and health to be;

Christ, only Christ, 
for body, soul, and spirit,

Christ, only Christ,
here and eternally.
