# AdventistHymnal
Management and export tool for the Seventh-day Adventist hymnal into various presentation software, such as ProPresenter.

The hymn files and idea came from <a>https://github.com/ariseforgod/adventist_hymnal</a>. The repository is no longer maintained, so I wrote this new program to manage the hymns and assist in the importing process into ProPresenter. Other software can be supported, but contributions will be required to get them working. The framework is here for it, though. It just needs a bit of work.

## How to use
The hymns for ProPresenter are already prepared in the 'Outputs/ProPresenter' folder. If you would like to further customize the aesthetic, manual tweaking of the generation system will be required. But they work if you just mass import them as .txt files.

## Todo
- Improve abstraction to allow other exporters that may not have a similar syntax.
- Review copyright information
- Add author credits
- Review text for typos or other issues
- Phase out 'Inputs' folder in favor of the json database

## Closing notes
If you have questions or would like to contribute, please reach out to me on discord. My handle is kalradia.

I sincerely hope this helps you and your church up your presentation game and makes your life a bit easier.
