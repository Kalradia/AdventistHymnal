[Verse 1]
Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,
What that in dark earth many days has lain;
Love lives again, that with the dead has been;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

[Verse 2]
In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,
Thinking that He would never wake again,
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

[Verse 3]
Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,
He that for three days in the grave had lain;
Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.

[Verse 4]
When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,
Your touch can call us back to life again,
Field of our hearts that dead and bare have been;
Love is come again like wheat arising green.
