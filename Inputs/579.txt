[Verse 1]
’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

[Chorus]
God is love; we’re His little children.
God is love; we would be like Him.
’Tis love that makes us happy,
’Tis love that smooths the way;
It helps us mind, it makes us kind
To others every day.

[Verse 2]
This world is full of sorrow,
Of sickness, death, and sin;
With loving heart we’ll do our part,
And try some soul to win.

[Verse 3]
And when this life is over,
And we are called above
Our song shall be, eternally,
Of Jesus and His love.
