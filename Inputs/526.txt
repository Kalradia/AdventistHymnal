[Verse 1]
God sent His Son,
they called Him Jesus,
He came to love,
heal, and forgive;

He lived and died
to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove
my Saviour lives.

[Chorus]
Because He lives
I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives
all fear is gone;

Because I know
He holds the future.
And life is worth the living
just because He lives.

[Verse 2]
How sweet to hold
a newborn baby,
And feel the pride,
and joy He gives;

But greater still
the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days
because He lives.
