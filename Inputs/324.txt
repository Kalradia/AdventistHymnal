[Verse 1]
Just as I am, Thine own to be,
Friend of the young, who lovest me,
To consecrate myself to Thee,
O Jesus Christ, I come.

[Verse 2]
In the glad morning of my day,
My life to give, my vows to pay,
With no reserve and no delay,
With all my heart I come.

[Verse 3]
I would live ever in the light,
I would work ever for the right;
I would serve Thee with all my might;
Therefore, to Thee I come.

[Verse 4]
Just as I am, young, strong, and free,
To be the best that I can be
For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,
Lord of my life, I come.
