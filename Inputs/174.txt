[Verse 1]
Star of our hope! He’ll soon appear,
The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;
Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-
How welcome to the faithful soul!

[Verse 2]
From heaven angelic voices sound:
Behold the Lord of glory crowned,
Arrayed in majesty divine,
And in His highest glories shine.

[Verse 3]
The grave yields up its precious trust,
Which long has slumbered in the dust,
Resplendent forms ascending, fair,
Now meet the Saviour in the air.

[Verse 4]
Descending with His azure throne,
He claims the kingdom for His own;
The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,
And hail Him their triumphant King.
