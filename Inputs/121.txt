[Chorus]
Go, tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere:
Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born!

[Verse 1]
While shepherds kept their watching
O’er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

[Verse 2]
The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! Above the earth
Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Saviour’s birth.

[Verse 3]
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born,
And brought us God’s salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.
