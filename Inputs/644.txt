[Verse 1]
O God, whose will is life and good
For all of mortal breath:
Unite in bonds of servanthood
All those who strive with death.

[Verse 2]
Make strong their hands and hearts and wills
To drive disease afar,
To strive against the body’s ills
And wage Your healing war.

[Verse 3]
By healing of the sick and blind,
Christ’s mercy they proclaim,
Make known the great physician’s mind,
Affirm the Saviour’s name.

[Verse 4]
Before them set Your gracious will,
That they, with heart and soul,
To You may consecrate their skill
And make the sufferer whole.
