[Verse 1]
Lo, how a rose e’re blooming
From tender stem hath sprung,
Of Jesse’s lineage coming
As men of old have sung.

It came, a floweret bright,
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night.

[Verse 2]
Isaiah ’twas foretold it,
The Rose I have in mind,
With Mary we beheld it,
The virgin mother kind.

To show God’s love aright
She bore to them a Saviour,
When half spent was the night.
