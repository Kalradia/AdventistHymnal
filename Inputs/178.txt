[Verse 1]
Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human views;
But through suffering, death, and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two.

[Chorus]
O behold the Man of Sorrows!
O behold Him in plain view!

Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since her rent the veil in two;
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror
Since her rent the veil in two.

[Verse 2]
Yes, He is with God, the Father,
Interceding there for you;
For He is the Well beloved
Since He rent the veil in two.

[Verse 3]
Holy angels bow before Him,
Men of earth give praises due;
For He is the mighty Conqueror
Since He rent the veil in two.
