[Verse 1]
Jesus, with Thy church abide;
Be her Saviour, Lord, and Guide,
While on earth her faith is tried:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

[Verse 2]
May her voice be ever clear,
Warning of a judgment near,
Telling of a Saviour dear:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

[Verse 3]
May she guide the poor and blind,
Seek the lost until she find,
And the broken hearted bind:
We beseech Thee, hear us.

[Verse 4]
May she holy triumps win,
Overthrow the hosts of sin,
Gather all the nations in:
We beseech Thee, hear us.
