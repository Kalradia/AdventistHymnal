[Verse 1]
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

[Chorus]
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

[Verse 2]
Though they are slighting him, still he is waiting,
waiting the penitent child to receive;
plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
he will forgive if they only believe.

[Verse 3]
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
back to the narrow way patiently win them;
tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.
