[Verse 1]
There’s a Spirit in the air, telling Christians everywhere
“Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.”

Lose your shyness, find your tongue; tell the world what God has done:
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.

[Verse 3]
When believers break the bread, when a hungry child is fed:
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

[Verse 4]
Still His Spirit leads the fight, seeing wrong and setting right:
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.

[Verse 5]
When a stranger’s not alone, where the homeless find a home,
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.

[Verse 6]
May His Spirit fill our praise, guide our thoughts and change our ways.
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His power today.

[Verse 7]
There’s a Spirit in the air, calling people everywhere;
Praise the love that Christ revealed: living, working in our world.
