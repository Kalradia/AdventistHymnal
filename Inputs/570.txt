[Verse 1]
Not I, but Christ,
be honoured, loved, exalted;
Not I, but Christ,
be seen, be known, be heard;

Not I, but Christ,
in every look and action,
Not I, but Christ,
in every thought and word.

[Verse 2]
Not I, but Christ,
to gently soothe in sorrow,
Not I, but Christ,
to wipe the falling tear;

Not I, but Christ,
to lift the weary burden,
Not I, but Christ,
to hush away all fear.

[Verse 3]
Christ, only Christ!
No idle words e’er falling,
Christ, only Christ;
no needless bustling sound;

Christ, only Christ,
no self important bearing;
Christ, only Christ,
no trace of “I” be found.

[Verse 4]
Not I, but Christ,
my every need supplying,
Not I, but Christ,
my strength and health to be;

Christ, only Christ, 
for body, soul, and spirit,
Christ, only Christ,
here and eternally.
