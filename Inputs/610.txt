[Verse 1]
O Christian, awake! ’tis the Master’s command;
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand,
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

[Chorus]
Stand like the brave, stand like the brave,
Stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

[Verse 2]
The cause of thy Master with vigor defend;
Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end;
Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go,
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

[Verse 3]
Press on, never doubting, thy Captain is near,
With grace to supply, and with comfort to cheer;
His love, like a stream in the desert will flow;
Then stand like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
