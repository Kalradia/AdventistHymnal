[Verse 1]
Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whenever we hear that glorious Word!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

[Verse 2]
Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children’s fate.
If they, like them, could die for thee!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

[Verse 3]
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
