[Verse 1]
Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
and publish abroad his wonderful name;
the name all-victorious of Jesus extol,
his kingdom is glorious and rules over all.

[Verse 2]
God ruleth on high, almighty to save,
and still he is nigh, his presence we have;
the great congregation his triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.

[Verse 3]
“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”
Let all cry aloud and honour the Son;
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.

[Verse 4]
Then let us adore and give him his right,
all glory and power, all wisdom and might;
all honour and blessing with angels above,
and thanks never ceasing and infinite love.
