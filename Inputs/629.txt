[Verse 1]
O happy band of pilgrims,
If onward ye will tread
With Jesus as your fellow,
To Jesus as your Head!

[Verse 2]
O happy if ye labour
As Jesus did for men;
O happy if ye hunger
As Jesus hungered then!

[Verse 3]
The trials that beset you,
The sorrows ye endure,
The manifold temptations
That death alone can cure,

[Verse 4]
What are they but His jewels
Of right celestial worth?
What are they but the ladder
Set up to heaven on earth?

[Verse 5]
O happy band of pilgrims,
Look upward to the skies,
Where such a light affliction
Shall win you such a prize!
