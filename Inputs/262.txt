[Verse 1]
There’s a sweet, sweet spirit in this place,
And I know that it’s the spirit of the Lord;

[Verse 2]
There are sweet expressions on each face,
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord.

[Chorus]
Sweet Holy Spirit,
Sweet Heavenly Dove,
Stay right here with us,
Filling us with Your love,

And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise,
Without a doubt we’ll know
That we have been revived
When we shall leave this place.
