[Verse 1]
What does the Lord require for praise and offering?
What sacrifice, desire or tribute bid you bring?
Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

[Verse 2]
Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice show?
Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?
Do justly; Love mercy; Walk humbly with your God.

[Verse 3]
How shall our life fulfil God’s law so hard and high?
Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.
Then justly, in mercy we’ll humbly walk with God.
