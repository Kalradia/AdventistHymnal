Every where I go, I’m going to let it shine, (shine)
Every where I go, I’m going to let it shine, (shine)
Every where I go, I’m going to let it shine,

All through the night, I’m going to let it shine, (shine)
All through the night, I’m going to let it shine, (shine)
All through the night, I’m going to let it shine,
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.
