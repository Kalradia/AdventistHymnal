[Verse 1]
On a hill far away
stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame;
and I love that old cross
where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

[Chorus]
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a crown.

[Verse 2]
O that old rugged cross,
so despised by the world,
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God
left his glory above
to bear it to dark Calvary.

[Verse 3]
To that old rugged cross
I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear;
then he’ll call me some day
to my home far away,
where his glory forever I’ll share.
