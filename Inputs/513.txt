[Verse 1]
In heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;
And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.
The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;
But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?

[Verse 2]
Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;
My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.

[Verse 3]
Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;
Bright skies will soon be o’er me, Where darkest clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;
My Saviour has my teasure, And He will walk with me.
