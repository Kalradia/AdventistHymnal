[Verse 1]
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming,
You will see your Lord a-coming
In a few more days.

[Chorus]
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music,
Hear the band of music
which is sounding thro’ the air.

[Verse 2]
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet,
Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet
In a few more days.

[Verse 3]
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising,
You will see the saints arising
In a few more days.

[Verse 4]
Angels bear them to the Saviour,
Angels bear them to the Saviour,
Angels bear them to the Saviour
In a few more days.

[Verse 5]
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over,
Then we’ll shout, our suff’ring over
In a few more days.
