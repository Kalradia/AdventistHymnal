[Verse 1]
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all.

[Verse 2]
Each little flow’r that opens
Each little bird that sings
He made their glowing colours
He made their tiny wings.

[Verse 3]
The purple-headed mountain
The river running by
The sunset and the morning
That brighten up the sky.

[Verse 4]
The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun
The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them, every one.

[Verse 5]
He gave us eyes to see them
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty
Who has made all things well.
