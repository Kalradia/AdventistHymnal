[Verse 1]
Jesus, stand among us
In Thy risen power;
Let this time of worship
Be a hallowed hour.

[Verse 2]
Breathe the Holy Spirit
Into every heart;
Bid the fears and sorrows
From each soul depart.

[Verse 3]
Thus with quickened footsteps
We pursue our way,
Watching for the dawning
Of eternal day.
