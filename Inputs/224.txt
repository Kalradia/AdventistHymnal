[Verse 1]
Seek ye first the kingdom,
’Tis your Father’s will.
So the voice of Jesus bids us follow still.
Saviour, we would hear Thee,
Follow, find, and see;
And in life’s adventure Thy disciples be.

[Verse 2]
As for hidden treasure,
Or for matchless pearl,
When at last discovered,
some will sell their all;
So, when breaks the vision of that
kingdom fair,
Ours shall be its riches And its beauty rare.

[Verse 3]
As the silent leaven works its secret way,
Or as grows the seed grain
through the night and day;
Lord, so be the increase, peaceable but sure,
Of Thy word within us,
And Thy kingdom’s power.

[Verse 4]
As the tender seedling grows up
tall and strong,
And the birds of heaven to its
branches throng; So shall all God’s children,
from the east and west,
Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.

[Verse 5]
Humblest shall be greatest,
poor in spirit reign;
Home shall come the childlike,
born through Thee again;
Eager hearts arrive there on the
pilgrim’s road,
Hail! The kingdom glorious of the living God!
