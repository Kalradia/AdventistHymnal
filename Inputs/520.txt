[Verse 1]
A wonderful Saviour
is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Saviour to me,
He hideth my soul
in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

[Chorus]
He hideth my soul
in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry,
thirsty land;
he hideth my life
in the depths of His love,

And covers me there
with His hand,
And covers me there
with His hand.

[Verse 2]
A wonderful Saviour
is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away,
He holdeth me up,
and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

[Verse 3]
With numberless blessings
each moment He crowns,
And filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture,
Oh, Glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine.

[Verse 4]
When clothed in His brightness,
transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation,
His wonderful love,
I’ll shout with the millions on high.
