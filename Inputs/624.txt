[Verse 1]
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
All along my pilgrim journey,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

[Verse 2]
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my trials, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When the shades of life are falling,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)

[Verse 3]
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
In my sorrows, Lord walk with me.
(walk with me)
When my heart within is aching,
I want Jesus to walk with me.
(walk with me)
