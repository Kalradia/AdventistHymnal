[Verse 1]
We gather together to ask
the Lord’s blessing;
He chastens and hastens
His will to make known.
The wicked oppressing
now cease from distressing.
Sing praises to His Name;
He forgets not His own.

[Verse 2]
Beside us to guide us,
our God with us joining,
Ordaining, maintaining
His kingdom divine;
So from the beginning the
fight we were winning;
Thou, Lord, were at our side,
all glory be Thine!

[Verse 3]
We all do extol Thee,
Thou leader triumphant,
And pray that Thou still
our defender wilt be.
Let Thy congregation
escape tribulation;
Thy name be ever praised!
O Lord, make us free!
