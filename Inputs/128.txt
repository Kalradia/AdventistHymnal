[Verse 1]
Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,
And usher in the morning;
Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,
But hear the angel’s warning.

This Child, now weak in infancy,
Our confidence and joy shall be,
The power of Satan breaking,
Our peace eternal making.

[Verse 2]
Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light,
To herald our salvation;
He stoops to earth - the God of might,
Our hope and expectation.

He comes in human flesh to dwell,
Our God with us, Immanuel,
The night of darkness ending,
Our fallen race befriending.
