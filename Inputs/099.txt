[Verse 1]
Be not dismayed whate’er betide,
God will take care of you;
beneath his wings of love abide,
God will take care of you.

[Chorus]
God will take care of you,
through every day, o’er all the way;
he will take care of you,
God will take care of you.

[Verse 2]
Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
when dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

[Verse 3]
All you may need he will provide,
God will take care of you;
nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.

[Verse 4]
No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
lean, weary one, upon his breast,
God will take care of you.
