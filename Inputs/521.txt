Hymnal:Hymn 521

[Verse 1]
Depth of mercy!–can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

[Verse 2]
I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

[Verse 3]
Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my sins lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.

[Verse 4]
There for me the Saviour stands,
Shows His wounds and spreads His hands;
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.
