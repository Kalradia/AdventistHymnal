[Verse 1]
For the beauty of the earth,
for the glory of the skies,
for the love which from our birth
over and around us lies;
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
this our grateful song of praise.

[Verse 2]
For the joy of human love,
brother, sister, parent, child,
friends on earth and friends above,
Pleasures pure and undefiled,
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
this our grateful song of praise.

[Verse 3]
For the gift of Thy dear Son,
for the hope of heaven at last,
for the Spirit’s victory won,
For the crown when life is past,
Lord of all, to Thee we raise
Songs of gratitude and praise.
