[Verse 1]
The Lord is coming, let this be
The herald note of jubilee;
And when we meet and when we part
The salutation from the heart.

[Chorus]
The Lord is coming, let this be
The herald note of jubilee,
The herald note of jubilee.

[Verse 2]
The Lord is coming, sound it forth
From east to west, from south to north;
Speed on! Speed on the tidings glad,
That none who love Him may be sad.

[Verse 3]
The Lord is coming, swift and sure
And all His judgements shall endure,
And none can hope to escape His wrath,
Who walk not in the narrow path.

[Verse 4]
This earth, with her ten thousand wrongs
Will soon be tuned to nobler songs;
Our praise shall then, in realms of light,
With all His universe unite.
