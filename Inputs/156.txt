[Verse 1]
O sacred Head, now wounded,
with grief and shame weighed down,
now scornfully surrounded
with thorns, thine only crown:

how pale thou art with anguish,
with sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish
which once was bright as morn!

[Verse 2]
What thou, my Lord, has suffered
was all for sinners’ gain;
mine, mine was the transgression,
but thine the deadly pain.

Lo, here I fall, my Saviour!
’Tis I deserve thy place;
look on me with thy favour,
vouchsafe to me thy grace.

[Verse 3]
What language shall I borrow
to thank thee, dearest friend,
for this thy dying sorrow,
thy pity without end?

O make me thine forever;
and should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
outlive my love for thee.
