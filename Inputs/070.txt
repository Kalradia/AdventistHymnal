[Verse 1]
Praise ye the Father for His loving kindness,
Tenderly cares He for His erring children;
Praise Him, ye angels, praise Him in the heavens;
Praise ye Jehovah!

[Verse 2]
Praise ye the Saviour, great is the compassion,
Graciously cares He for His chosen people;
Young men and maidens, ye old men and children,
Praise ye the Saviour!

[Verse 3]
Praise ye the Spirit, comforter of Israel,
Sent of the Father and the Son to bless us;
Praise ye the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Praise the Eternal Three!
