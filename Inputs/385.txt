[Verse 1]
Crowning jewel of creation,
Blest and hallowed, sanctified;
Time and changes all transcending,
Shared forever, glorified.

[Chorus]
Blessed Sabbath made for man,
Gift from the Creator’s hand.

[Verse 2]
Sin and sickness, prayer and weeping
Cease at close of earthly days;
But Thy Sabbath is eternal,
Joyful thanks to Thee we raise!

[Verse 3]
Teach us Lord, in storm or sunshine
How to truly rest in Thee,
May Thy Sabbath peace enfold us
And our shelter ever be.
