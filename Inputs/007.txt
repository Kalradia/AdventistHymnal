[Verse 1]
The Lord in Zion reigneth,
let all the world rejoice,
And come before His throne of grace
with tuneful heart and voice;
The Lord in Zion reigneth,
and there His praise shall ring,
To Him shall princes bend the knee
and kings their glory bring.

[Verse 2]
The Lord in Zion reigneth,
and who so great as He?
The depths of earth are in His hands;
He rules the mighty sea.
O crown His Name with honour,
and let His standard wave,
Till distant isles beyond the deep
shall own His power to save.

[Verse 3]
The Lord in Zion reigneth,
these hours to Him belong;
O enter now His temple gates,
and fill His courts with song;
Beneath His royal banner
let every creature fall,
Exalt the King of heaven and earth,
and crown Him Lord of all.
