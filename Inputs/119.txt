[Verse 1]
Angels from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o’er all the earth;
Ye, who sang creation’s story,
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth;
Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[Verse 2]
Shepherds, in the field abiding,
Watching o’er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing;
Yonder shines the Infant Light;
Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[Verse 3]
Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of nations;
Ye have seen His natal star;
Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.

[Verse 4]
Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear;
Come and worship, Come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.
