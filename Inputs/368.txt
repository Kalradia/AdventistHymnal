Hymnal:Hymn 368

[Verse 1]
Watchman, blow the gospel trumpet,
Every soul a warning give;
Whosoever hears the message
May repent, and, turn and live.

[Chorus]
Blow the trumpet, trusty watchman,
Blow it loud o’er land and sea;
God commissions, sound the message!
Every captive may be free.

[Verse 2]
Sound it loud o’er every hilltop,
Gloomy shade and sunny plain;
Ocean depths repeat the message,
Full salvation’s glad refrain.

[Verse 3]
Sound it in the hedge and highway,
Earth’s dark spots where exiles roam;
Let it tell all things are ready,
Father waits to welcome home.

[Verse 4]
Sound it for the heavy laden,
Weary, longing to be free;
Sound a Saviour’s invitation,
Sweetly saying, “Come to me.”
