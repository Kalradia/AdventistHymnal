[Verse 1]
When He cometh, when He cometh
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.

[Chorus]
Like the stars of the morning,
His brightness adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.

[Verse 2]
He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom;
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.

[Verse 3]
Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.
