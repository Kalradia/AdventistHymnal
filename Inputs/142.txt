[Verse 1]
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing oâ€™er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains.

[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

[Verse 2]
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

[Verse 3]
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

[Verse 4]
See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.
