[Verse 1]
Saviour, breathe an evening blessing,
Ere repose our spirits seal;
Sin and want we come confessing;
Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

[Verse 2]
Though the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
Thou art He who, never weary,
Watchest where Thy people be.

[Verse 3]
Though destruction walk around us.
Though the arrow past us fly,
Angel guards from Thee Surround us,
We are safe if Thou art nigh.

[Verse 4]
Should swift death this night o’re-take us,
And our couch become our tomb,
May the morn of glory wake us,
Clad in light and deathless bloom.
