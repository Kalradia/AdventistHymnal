[Verse 1]
Jesus, Friend of little children,
Be a friend to me;
Take my hand and ever keep me
Close to Thee.

[Verse 2]
Teach me how to grow in goodness,
Daily as I grow;
Thou hast been a child, and surely
Thou dost know.

[Verse 3]
Step by step, O, lead me onward,
Upward into youth;
Wiser, stronger, still becoming
In Thy truth.

[Verse 4]
Never leave me, nor forsake me;
Ever be my friend;
For I need Thee from life’s dawning
To its end.
