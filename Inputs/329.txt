[Verse 1]
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
All its Joys are but a name,
But His love abideth ever,
Through eternal years the same.

[Chorus]
Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
Oh, the length and breadth of love!
Oh, the fullness of redemption,
Pledge of endless life above.

[Verse 2]
Take the world, but give me Jesus,
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Saviour watching o’er me,
I can sing, though billows roll.

[Verse 3]
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
Let me view his constant smile;
Then throughout my pilgrim journey
Light will cheer me all the while.

[Verse 4]
Take the world, but give me Jesus;
In His cross my trust shall be,
Till, with clearer, brighter vision
Face to face my Lord I see.
