[Verse 1]
Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

[Chorus]
’Tis the Lord, O wondrous story,
’Tis the Lord, the King of glory!
At His feet we humbly fall,
Crown Him, crown Him Lord of all.
At His feet we humbly fall- the Lord of all.
Crown Him, crown Him, Jesus, Jesus,
Crown Him Lord of all.

[Verse 2]
Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

[Verse 3]
Who is He, the gathering throng
Greet with loud triumphant song?

[Verse 4]
Lo, at midnight, who is He
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

[Verse 5]
Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in shame and agony?

[Verse 6]
Who is He that from the grave
Comes to heal and help and save?

[Verse 7]
Who is He that from His throne
Rules through all the world alone?
