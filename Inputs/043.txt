[Verse 1]
When morning gilds the skies my heart awaking cries,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and prayer, to Jesus I repair:
May Jesus Christ be praised!

[Verse 2]
Whene’er the sweet church bell peals over hill and dell,
May Jesus Christ praised!
O hark to what it sings, as joyously it rings,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

[Verse 3]
The night becomes as day when from the heart we say:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The powers of darkness fear when this sweet chant they hear:
May Jesus Christ be praised!

[Verse 4]
Ye nations of mankind, in this your concord find,
May Jesus Christ praised!
Let all the earth around ring joyous with the sound,
May Jesus Christ praised!

[Verse 5]
In heaven’s eternal bliss the loveliest strain is this,
May Jesus Christ praised!
Let earth, and sea and sky from depth to height reply,
May Jesus Christ praised!

[Verse 6]
Be this, while life is mine, my canticle divine:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Be this th’eternal song through all the ages long,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
