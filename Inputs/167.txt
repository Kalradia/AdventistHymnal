[Verse 1]
Alleluia! sing to Jesus!
His the scepter, His the throne.
Alleluia! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.

Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion
thunder like a mighty flood.
Jesus out of every nation
has redeemed us by His blood.

[Verse 2]
Alleluia! not as orphans
are we left in sorrow now;
Alleluia! He is near us,
faith believes, nor questions how;

Though the cloud from sight received Him
when the forty days were o’er
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
“I am with you evermore”?

[Verse 3]
Alleluia! bread of heaven,
Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Alleluia! here the sinful
flee to Thee from day to day:

Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,
Where the songs of all the sinless
sweep across the crystal sea.
