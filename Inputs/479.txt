[Verse 1]
Be silent, be silent, A whisper is heard;
Be silent, and listen, Oh treasure each word.

[Chorus]
Tread softly, tread softly, The Master is here;
Tread softly here, tread softly here,
Tread softly, tread softly, He bids us draw near.
Tread softly here, tread softly here,

[Verse 2]
Be silent, be silent, For holy this place,
This altar that echoes The message of grace.

[Verse 3]
Be silent, be silent, Breathe humbly our prayer;
A foretaste of Eden This moment we share.

[Verse 4]
Be silent, be silent, His mercy record;
Be silent, be silent, And wait on the Lord.
