[Verse 1]
There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
To gather His loved ones home.

[Chorus]
To gather His loved ones home,
To gather His loved ones home.
There’ll be no dark valleys when Jesus comes,
To gather His loved ones home.

[Verse 2]
There’ll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
There’ll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
There’ll be a happy tomorrow when Jesus comes,
To gather His loved ones home.

[Verse 3]
There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
There’ll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
To gather His loved ones home.
