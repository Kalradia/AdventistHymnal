[Verse 1]
Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
He had to walk it by Himself.
O nobody else could walk it for Him.
He had to walk it by Himself.

[Verse 2]
I must go and stand my trial.
I have to stand it by myself.
O nobody else could stand it for me.
I have to stand it by myself.

[Verse 3]
Jesus walked this lonesome valley;
He had to walk it by Himself.
O nobody else could walk it for Him.
He had to walk it by Himself.
