[Verse 1]
Seeking the lost,
yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray;

“Come unto Me,”
His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.

[Chorus]
Going afar
upon the mountain
Bringing the wanderer back again,
back again,

Into the fold
Of my Redeemer
Jesus the Lamb for sinners slain,
for sinners slain.

[Verse 2]
Seeking the lost
and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak
and hearts that are sore,

Leading them forth
in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.

[Verse 3]
Thus would I go
on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day unto day,

Cheering the faint
and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way.
