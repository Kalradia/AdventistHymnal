[Verse 1]
Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever I am.

[Chorus]
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child and forever I am.

[Verse 2]
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

[Verse 3]
I know there’s a crown that is waiting
In yonder bright mansion for me;
And soon, with the spirit made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.
