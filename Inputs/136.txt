[Verse 1]
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say:
Jesus Christ is born today;

Ox and ass before Him bow,
And He is in the manger now.
Christ is born today!
Christ is born today!

[Verse 2]
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Jesus Christ was born for this!

He hath ope’d the heav’nly door,
And we are blessed evermore.
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!

[Verse 3]
Good Christians, now rejoice,
With heart, and soul, and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave:
Jesus Christ was born to save!

Calls you one and calls you all
To gain His everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!
