[Verse 1]
The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now;
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty victor’s brow.

[Verse 2]
The highest place that heaven affords
Is His, is His by right;
The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
And heaven’s eternal light.

[Verse 3]
The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.

[Verse 4]
To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.

[Verse 5]
To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace is given;
Their name an everlasting name,
Their joy the joy of heaven.
