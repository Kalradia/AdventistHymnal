[Verse 1]
Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,
Let the dying look and live;
To all weary, thirsting sinners,
Living waters will He give;
And though once so meek and lowly,
Yet the Prince of heaven was He;
And the blind, who grope in darkness,
Through the blood of Christ shall see.

[Chorus]
Lift Him up, the risen Saviour,
High amid the waiting throng;
Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,
Now He bids you flee from wrong.

[Verse 2]
Lift Him up, this precious Saviour,
Let the multitude behold;
They with willing hearts shall seek Him,
He will draw them to His fold;
They shall gather from the wayside,
Hastening on with joyous feet,
They shall bear the cross of Jesus,
And shall find salvation sweet.

[Verse 3]
Lift Him up in all His glory,
’Tis the Son of God on high;
Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,
Eén the careless shall draw nigh;
Let them hear again the story
Of the cross, the death of shame;
And from tongue to tongue repeat it;
Mighty throngs shall bless His name.

[Verse 4]
O then lift Him up in singing,
Lift the Saviour up in prayer;
He, the glorious Redeemer,
All the sins of men did bear;
Yes, the young shall bow before Him,
And the old their voices raise;
All the deaf shall hear hosannah;
And the dumb shall shout His praise.
