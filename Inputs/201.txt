[Verse 1]
Christ is coming! let creation
Bid her groans and travail cease;
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore and faith increase;
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
(Prince of Peace!)
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

[Verse 2]
Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign;
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain.
(repeat the strain)
Let each heart repeat the strain.

[Verse 3]
With that “blessed hope” before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll from tongue to tongue:
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
(quickly come!)
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!
