[Verse 1]
This is My will, My one command,
That love should dwell among you all.
This is My will that you should love
As I have shown that I love you.

[Verse 2]
No greater love a man can have
Than that he die to save his friends.
You are My friends if you obey
What I command that you should do.

[Verse 3]
You chose not Me, but I chose you
That you should go and bear much fruit.
I chose you out that you in Me
Should bear much fruit that will abide.

[Verse 4]
All that I ask My Father, dear,
For My nameâ€™s sake you shall receive.
This is My will, My one command,
That love should dwell in each, in all.
