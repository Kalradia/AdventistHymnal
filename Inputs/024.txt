[Verse 1]
Every star shall sing a carol;
Every creatures, high or low,
Come and praise the King of heaven
By whatever name you know.
God above, Man below,
Holy is the name I know.

[Verse 2]
When the King of all creation
Had a cradle on the earth,
Holy was the human body,
Holy was the human birth.
God above, Man below,
Holy is the name I know.

[Verse 3]
Every star and every planet,
Every creature, high or low,
Come and praise the King of heaven
By whatever name you know.
God above, Man below,
Holy is the name I know.
