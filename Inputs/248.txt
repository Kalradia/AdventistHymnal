[Verse 1]
There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ears,
The sweetest Name on earth.

[Chorus]
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
O how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me.

[Verse 2]
It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of a Saviour’s blood,
The sinners’ perfect plea.

[Verse 3]
It tells of one whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe;
Who in each sorrow bears
A part that none can bear below.
