[Verse 1]
Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
chosen of the Lord, and precious,
binding all the Church in one;
holy Zion’s help for ever,
and her confidence alone.

[Verse 2]
All that dedicated city,
dearly loved of God on high,
in exultant jubilation
pours perpetual melody;
God the One in Three adoring
in glad hymns eternally.

[Verse 3]
To this temple, where we call thee,
come, O Lord of Hosts, today;
with thy wonted loving-kindness
hear thy servants as they pray,
and thy fullest benediction
shed within its walls alway.

[Verse 4]
Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
what they ask of thee of gain;
what they gain from thee, for ever
with the blessed to retain,
and hereafter in thy glory
evermore with thee to reign.

[Verse 5]
Laud and honour to the Father,
laud and honour to the Son,
laud and honour to the Spirit,
ever Three, and ever One,
con-substantial, co-eternal,
while unending ages run.
