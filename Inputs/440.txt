[Verse 1]
How cheering is the Christian’s hope,
While toiling here below!
It bouys us up while this passing through
This wilderness of woe,

[Verse 2]
It bouys us up while this passing through
This wilderness of woe,
It bouys us up while passing through
This wilderness of woe.

[Verse 3]
It points us to a land of rest,
Where saints with Christ will reign;
Where we shall meet the loved of earth,
And never part again.

[Verse 4]
Fly, lingering moments, fly, O, fly,
Dear Saviour, quickly come!
We long to see Thee as Thou art,
And reach that blissful home.
