[Verse 1]
O holy Dove of God descending,
You are the love that knows no ending.
All of our shattered dreams You’re mending:
Spirit, now live in me.

[Verse 2]
O holy Wind of God now blowing,
You are the seed that God us sowing.
You are the life that starts us growing:
Spirit, now live in me.

[Verse 3]
O holy Rain of God now falling,
You make the Word of God enthralling,
You are that inner voice now calling:
Spirit, now live in me.

[Verse 4]
O holy Flame of God now burning,
You are the power of Christ returning.
You are the answer to our yearning:
Spirit, now live in me.
