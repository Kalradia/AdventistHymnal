[Verse 1]
As Jacob with travel was weary one day,
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;
He saw in a vision a ladder so high
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.

[Chorus]
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.

[Verse 2]
Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:
And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.

[Verse 3]
And when we arrive at the haven of rest
We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”
O who would not climb such a ladder as this?
