[Verse 1]
Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies.
Against the foe in vales below,
Let all our strength be hurled;
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.

[Chorus]
Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
Oh, glorious victory
That overcomes the world.

[Verse 2]
On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And on-ward to the fray;
Salvation's helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
And echo with our shout.

[Verse 3]
To him that overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav'n.
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conq'ring name.
