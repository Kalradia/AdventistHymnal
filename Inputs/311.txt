Hymnal:Hymn 311

[Verse 1]
Earthly pleasures vainly call me;
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;
I would be like Jesus.

[Chorus]
Be like Jesus, this my song,
In the home and in the throng;
Be like Jesus, all day long!
I would be like Jesus.

[Verse 2]
He has broken every fetter,
I would be like Jesus;
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus.

[Verse 3]
All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus;
Telling o’er and o’er the story,
I would be like Jesus.

[Verse 4]
That in Heaven He may meet me,
I would be like Jesus;
That His words “Well done” may greet me,
I would be like Jesus.
