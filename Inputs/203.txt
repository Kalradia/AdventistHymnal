[Verse 1]
This is the threefold truth
On which our faith depends;
And with this joyful cry
Worship begins and ends;

[Chorus]
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

[Verse 2]
By this we are upheld
When doubt and grief assails
Our Christian fortitude,
And only grace avails.

[Verse 3]
This is the threefold truth
Which, if we hold it fast,
Changes the world and us
And brings us home at last.
