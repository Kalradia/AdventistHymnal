[Verse 1]
Come, let us sing the song of songs-
The angels first began the strain-
The homage which to Christ belongs:
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

[Verse 2]
Slain to redeem us by His blood,
To cleanse from every sinful stain,
And make us kings and priests to God:
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

[Verse 3]
To Him who suffered on the tree,
Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,
Blessing, and praise, and glory be:
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

[Verse 4]
To Him, enthroned by filial right
All power in heaven and earth proclaim,
Honour, and majesty, and might:
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”

[Verse 5]
Long as we live, and when we die,
And while in heaven with Him we reign,
This song our song of songs shall be:
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”
