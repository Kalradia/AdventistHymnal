[Verse 1]
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
the shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land;

a home within the wilderness,
a rest upon the way,
from the burning of the noontide heat,
and the burden of the day.

[Verse 2]
Upon that cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see
the very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;

and from my stricken heart with tears
two wonders I confess:
the wonders of redeeming love
and my unworthiness.

[Verse 3]
I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of his face;

content to let the world go by,
to know no gain nor loss,
my sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross.
