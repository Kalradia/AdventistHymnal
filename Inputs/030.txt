[Verse 1]
Holy God, we praise Your name;
Lord of all, we bow before You!
All on earth Your scepter claim,
All in heaven above adore You;
Infinite Your vast domain.
Everlasting is Your reign.

[Verse 2]
Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

[Verse 3]
Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, three we name You;
While in essence only one,
Undivided God we claim You;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.
