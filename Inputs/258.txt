[Verse 1]
Baptize us anew
With power from on high,
With love, O refresh us!
Dear Saviour, draw nigh.

[Chorus 1]
We humbly beseech Thee,
Lord Jesus, we pray,
With love and the Spirit
baptize us today.

[Verse 2]
Unworthy we cry,
Unholy, unclean,
O wash us and cleanse us
From sin’s guilty stain.

[Verse 3]
O heavenly Dove,
Descend from on high!
We plead Thy rich blessing;
In mercy draw nigh.

[Verse 4]
O list the glad voice!
From heaven it came:
Thou art My beloved,
Well pleased I am.

[Chorus 2]
We praise Thee, we bless Thee,
dear Lamb that was slain,
We laud and adore Thee,
Amen and Amen.
